# Personal Mastery
If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual.

# Good Design
A system should be built with a minimum set of unchangeable parts; those parts should be as general as possible; and all parts of the system should be held in a uniform framework.

# Purpose of Language
To provide a mean of commanding to the world

# Eval as a message sent to an environmnent
And environments as object to which we teach the environmnet (def...) or we query it.

# Polymorphism
A program should specify only the behavior of objects, not their representation.

# Execution as translation
FP fits well here because functions do not augment information, (mixing of bodies)
